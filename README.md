Using an Azure Subscription, I am creating a Virtual Machine environment on the cloud to act as a Honeypot in the hopes of attracting global attackers. With the log data, I will then use Log Analytics Workspace to ingest the logs and Sentinel SIEM to create a map to track attacker data, also utilizing a PowerShell script to extract the IP addresses from the Windows log, send them to 3rd party API to create geographic data.
